# FRC Xbox Button Test ðŸŽ®

This is my **first WPILib project**, built to detect Xbox controller button presses using the Java-based FRC framework.

ðŸ§ª **Purpose:**  
To explore how controller input works in WPILib, and to begin preparing for a position on my school's FRC robotics software team.

## ðŸ§  What It Does

- Detects A, B, X, and Y button presses on an Xbox controller
- Prints a message to the console like:  
  "Button A was pressed"
- Runs inside `teleopPeriodic()` method
- Built using WPILib 2025 and the Command-based robot template

## ðŸ’» How to Use

1. Plug in an Xbox controller
2. Run the code using simulation or on a RoboRIO
3. Enable Teleop mode
4. Press any button â€“ watch the console!

```bash
./gradlew simulateJava
